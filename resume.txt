Summary

   I'm passionate about solving problems, both through products and
   process improvement. I love to ship software that uplifts people and
   brings them together, and I love doing it with a team working at peak
   efficiency. I believe we choose what we build and how we build it, so
   let's make the right choices and make a difference.
